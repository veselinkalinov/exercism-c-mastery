# C Mastery: Exercism Solutions

A collection of rigorous C programming challenges from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/c), focused on memory safety, pointer manipulation, and performance optimization.

## 🛠 Technical Focus
This repository serves as a portfolio of my proficiency in low-level programming. Key areas demonstrated:
* **Memory Management:** Strategic use of `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free` with zero leak tolerance.
* **Defensive Programming:** Handling edge cases, `NULL` pointers, and buffer overflows.
* **Data Structures:** Custom implementations of Linked Lists, Trees, and Hash Maps.
* **Tooling:** Proficient use of `make`, `gcc` (with strict flags), and `valgrind`.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The exercises are categorized by difficulty to show progression:
* `/exercises/easy`: Fundamentals, syntax, and basic logic.
* `/exercises/medium`: Complex algorithms and manual memory handling.
* `/exercises/hard`: Advanced systems architecture and optimization.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To compile and run the tests for any exercise:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/exercism-c-mastery.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/exercism-c-mastery.git)
