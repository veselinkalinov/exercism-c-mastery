### 📖 About
This repository documents my journey through the **Introduction to Python** course during my first year at the **Technical University of Sofia**. 

It contains a collection of laboratory exercises, homework assignments, and algorithmic problems aimed at mastering the core concepts of Python programming and software engineering logic.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
Through these projects, I have implemented and practiced:
* **Core Syntax:** Variables, Data Types, and Operators.
* **Control Flow:** Conditional logic (`if/else`) and Loops (`for/while`).
* **Data Structures:** Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets manipulation.
* **Functions:** Modular programming, parameters, and return values.
* **Algorithms:** Basic sorting and searching implementation.
* **File Handling:** Reading from and writing to files (I/O operations).

### 💻 How to Run
To run any of the scripts locally, ensure you have Python installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/veselinkalinov/university-python-labs.git](https://github.com/veselinkalinov/university-python-labs.git)
