### 📖 About
This repository documents my progress through the **Introduction to C Programming** course at the **Technical University of Sofia**. 

It serves as a comprehensive archive of laboratory exercises, homework assignments, and algorithmic implementations designed to build a strong foundation in low-level software engineering, memory management, and computational logic, specifically tailored for the university's engineering curriculum.

### 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
* **Memory Management:** Manual allocation and deallocation using `malloc`, `calloc`, and `free`.
* **Pointers & References:** Pointer arithmetic, referencing, and dereferencing for efficient data handling.
* **Complex Data Types:** Implementation of Structures (`struct`), Unions, and Enums.
* **Modular Programming:** Usage of Header files (`.h`), function prototypes, and preprocessor directives.
* **File I/O:** Reading and writing data streams using standard input/output libraries.
* **Bitwise Operations:** Low-level data manipulation and hardware-oriented logic.

### 💻 How to Run
To run any of the programs locally, ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/veselinkalinov/university-c-labs.git](https://github.com/veselinkalinov/university-c-labs.git)
